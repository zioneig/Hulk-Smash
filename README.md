# Hulk-Smash
The hulk needs to reach the end of the city while crushing the most amount of people.
This program finds that optimal path and returns the number of people that were crushed.

The city is a square of any given size.
The city is an integer matrix and each element represents the amount of people in a single location.
The city is read in through a file.

A -1 represents a wall and the hulk is not allowed to walk over this spot, instead he must find a way around.
